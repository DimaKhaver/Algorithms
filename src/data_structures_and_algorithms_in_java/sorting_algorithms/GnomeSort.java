/*
Time Complexity – there are no nested loop (only one while) it may seem that this is a linear O(N) time algorithm.
The time complexity is O(N^2), our variable – ‘index’ does not always get incremented, it gets decremented too.
However this sorting algorithm is adaptive and performs better if the array is already/partially sorted.
Auxiliary Space –  This is an in-place algorithm. So O(1) auxiliary space is needed.
